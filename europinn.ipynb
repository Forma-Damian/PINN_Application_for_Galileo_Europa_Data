    "We use the csv file with data from Galileo spacecraft flyby of Europa to train a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to model the magnetic field around Europa. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. A neural network is defined with several hidden layers and trained using the Adam optimizer. The loss function combines the mean squared error of the predictions with the physical constraints of Maxwell's equations. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and the results are visualized through plots comparing predicted and actual magnetic field values."
